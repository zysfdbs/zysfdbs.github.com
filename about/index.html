<p><a href="/about/resume.pdf">My resume</a>. Be warned, it can be out of date at any time, and most likely does not include freelance work. I prefer you read my Github profile to see if I am any good at programming anyhow. And my blog to see if I am the type of person you want to work with.</p>

<p>Please check out my Github profile. It is a better estimate of my skill - or lack thereof - than any other page I can show you. Feel free to use the code there, file a bug, etc. as well.</p>
